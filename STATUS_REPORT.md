# Project Status Report & Next Steps

Here is an analysis of the Digital Memorial Platform's current implementation status based on `PROJECT.md`, with recommendations for prioritization.

#### **Overall Summary**

The project has a strong foundation. The backend API and the overall service architecture (Docker, Traefik, LiteLLM) are well-developed and seem to cover most of the MVP requirements. However, the **frontend is in a very early, "scaffolding" stage** and does not yet provide access to the backend functionality. The immediate priority is to build out the UI to expose the existing backend capabilities.

### **Capability Implementation Status**

#### **Phase 1: MVP Features**

**1. Story Management**
*   **Backend (Implemented):** `stories.py` provides API endpoints for story submission (CRUD) and likely browsing. Tagging and privacy controls are probably supported by the backend models.
*   **Frontend (Pending):**
    *   **High Priority:** A web form for submitting stories.
    *   **High Priority:** A page to browse and view stories (list/grid view).
    *   **Medium Priority:** A search bar component for story searching.
    *   **Low Priority:** UI for managing tags.

**2. User Management**
*   **Backend (Implemented):** `auth.py` and `users.py` handle registration and authentication. `authelia` integration suggests a robust authentication strategy. Admin functions are available via the API.
*   **Frontend (Pending):**
    *   **High Priority:** Login and Registration pages/forms.
    *   **Medium Priority:** A user profile page.
    *   **Low Priority:** Admin panel for user management and story approval.

**3. AI Chat Interface**
*   **Backend (Implemented):** `chat.py` endpoint exists. `litellm` integration means the backend can already connect to various AI models.
*   **Frontend (Pending):**
    *   **High Priority:** A dedicated chat page with a message-style interface. This is a core feature and a major user engagement driver.

**4. Memorial Administration**
*   **Backend (Implemented):** `memorials.py` allows for creating and managing memorials.
*   **Frontend (Pending):**
    *   **High Priority:** A form/wizard to create a new memorial.
    *   **Medium Priority:** A dashboard for managing an existing memorial's settings.

**5. User Interface**
*   **Backend (N/A)**
*   **Frontend (Pending):**
    *   **Critical Priority:** The entire UI is pending beyond the landing page. All the "pending" items in other sections fall under this. A component library (like the one intended for `src/components/ui`) needs to be built with buttons, forms, cards, modals, etc., to support the feature pages.

### **Recommended Prioritization & Next Steps**

The development focus should now shift almost entirely to the **frontend**. The goal is to make the powerful backend functionality accessible to users.

**Priority 1: Enable Core User Journey**

This involves creating the minimum set of pages and components to allow a user to register, create a memorial, submit a story, and view it.

1.  **Implement Authentication UI:**
    *   Create `LoginPage.tsx` and `RegisterPage.tsx`.
    *   Build the necessary forms in `src/components/forms`.
    *   Implement the API calls in `src/services/auth.ts`.
    *   Manage auth state (e.g., in Zustand store `src/store/authStore.ts`).

2.  **Implement Memorial Creation UI:**
    *   Create a `/memorials/new` page/route.
    *   Build a form for creating a memorial.

3.  **Implement Story Submission & Browsing:**
    *   Create a `/memorials/:id/stories` page to display stories.
    *   Create a reusable `<StoryCard />` component.
    *   Create a story submission form/modal.

**Priority 2: Implement AI Chat**

Once the core data is manageable, the AI chat interface should be the next focus as it's a key differentiator of the platform.

1.  **Build Chat UI:**
    *   Create a `ChatPage.tsx` at `/memorials/:id/chat`.
    *   Build a chat interface with a message history view and a text input.
    *   Connect it to the `api/v1/chat` backend endpoint.

**Priority 3: Flesh out Remaining MVP Features**

*   User Profile pages.
*   Admin dashboards for moderation.
*   Search and filtering functionality for stories.

By tackling the frontend in this order, you will progressively unlock the already-implemented backend features, creating a usable and valuable application in the shortest time possible. All Phase 2+ features from `PROJECT.md` should be considered blocked until the MVP frontend is complete.
