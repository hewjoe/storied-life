# Project Status Report & Next Steps

Here is an analysis of the Digital Legacy Platform's current implementation status based on `PROJECT.md`, with recommendations for prioritization.

#### **Overall Summary**

The project has a strong foundation with significant progress on authentication infrastructure. The backend API and the overall service architecture (Docker, Traefik, LiteLLM) are well-developed and cover most of the MVP requirements. **Authentication using Authentik has been fully implemented**, providing a robust foundation for user management and access control. However, the **frontend is still in a very early, "scaffolding" stage** and does not yet provide access to the backend functionality. The immediate priority is to build out the UI to expose the existing backend capabilities.

### **Authentication & Authorization Implementation Status**

#### **✅ COMPLETED: Authentik Integration**
*   **Authentication Service**: Fully migrated from Authelia to Authentik for identity management
*   **Forward Auth**: Traefik configured to handle authentication via Authentik at `auth.projecthewitt.info`
*   **User Management**: Automatic user creation from Authentik headers with group-based admin privileges
*   **Social Login Ready**: Authentik configured to support Google, Facebook, and Microsoft OAuth
*   **Authorization Framework**: Multi-level permission system (Anonymous → User → Family Admin → System Admin)
*   **API Endpoints**: Complete authentication API with status checking and user management
*   **Security**: JWT fallback authentication, bcrypt password hashing, session management
*   **Documentation**: Comprehensive AUTH.md covering all authentication aspects

#### **Visibility & Access Control System**
*   **Anonymous Access**: Main page accessible to anonymous users with public content
*   **Content Visibility Levels**: Private, Group, and Public content classification
*   **Group-based Permissions**: Family groups with admin controls
*   **Header-based Auth**: Seamless integration with Traefik forward-auth headers
